        name: "Herta Space Station",
        description1: "Herta Space Station is a massive orbital research hub and cosmic archive, created by Herta of the Genius Society to collect, study, and preserve the universe's strangest phenomena. More museum than military facility, the station stores sealed curios, Stellar artifacts, and dangerous anomalies from across the galaxy, each classified and contained with meticulous care. Its sterile halls and humming machinery reflect Herta's philosophy: knowledge is everything, and risk is an acceptable cost.",
        description2: "In the story, the station is the Trailblazer's first destination, where their journey begins amid chaos. A sudden invasion disrupts the station's carefully controlled environment, turning research zones into combat areas and forcing staff and visitors to flee or fight. Through this crisis, players are introduced to the core mysteries of the universe, including Stellarons and Aeons, while meeting key characters who will shape the path of the Trailblaze.",
        description3: "From a gameplay perspective, Herta Space Station serves as an introductory world that teaches exploration, turn-based combat, puzzles, and resource management. Its distinct zones—such as the Master Control Zone and Storage Areas—are filled with enemies, treasure, and interactive mechanics. The station also houses the Simulated Universe, a virtual system where players test their strength against increasingly difficult challenges, blending Herta’s lore-driven research with repeatable endgame gameplay.",
        description4: "Together, the station functions as a narrative starting point, a tutorial space, and a living piece of lore—an unstable sanctuary of knowledge where curiosity, danger, and the vast scale of the cosmos first collide.",

        name: "Jarilo VI",
        description1: "Jarilo-VI is a frozen, dying world locked in an endless winter, the result of a long-standing disaster known as the Eternal Freeze. Once a thriving planet, it now survives under layers of ice and snow, its surface hostile and nearly uninhabitable. Human civilization endures only through desperate adaptation, with the last remnants of society divided between the fortified city of Belobog and the lawless depths of the Underworld. The planet’s history is deeply tied to a Stellaron, whose influence slowly drove the world toward collapse.",
        description2: "In the story, Jarilo-VI becomes the Trailblazer’s first major planetary conflict. What begins as an attempt to help quickly evolves into a struggle against political control, social inequality, and distorted ideals of preservation. Players uncover the truth behind Belobog’s ruling structure, the legacy of past Guardians, and the heavy cost of choosing “survival at any price.” The planet’s narrative centers on human resilience, sacrifice, and the danger of clinging to false hope in the face of extinction.",
        description3: "From a gameplay perspective, Jarilo-VI expands on exploration and combat through its stark contrast of environments. The orderly streets of Belobog, the industrial decay of the Underworld, and the frozen wilderness beyond the city walls each introduce new enemies, mechanics, and puzzles. Side quests emphasize civilian struggles and personal stories, grounding the planetary crisis in everyday lives. Boss encounters and story dungeons reflect the planet’s themes, reinforcing the tension between protection and oppression.",
        description4: "As a whole, Jarilo-VI stands as a fully realized world where lore, gameplay, and narrative converge—a bleak yet deeply human chapter of the Trailblazer’s journey, proving that even in a world buried under ice, the will to fight for the future still burns.",

        name: "The Xianzhou Luofu",
        description1: "The Xianzhou Luofu is a colossal star-faring vessel, one of the Xianzhou Alliance’s six great ships, endlessly voyaging through the cosmos in pursuit of abundance and immortality. Built as both a civilization and a weapon, the Luofu embodies the Alliance’s paradoxical mission: to grant long life while resisting the corruption of eternal excess. Its streets resemble a living world rather than a spacecraft, blending ancient cultural aesthetics with advanced technology, all sustained within a self-contained ecosystem.",
        description2: "In the story, the Luofu becomes the Trailblazer’s entry point into a long-running ideological conflict between the Xianzhou Alliance and the followers of the Abundance. What begins as an investigation into a Stellaron crisis unfolds into a complex web of political intrigue, historical grudges, and moral ambiguity. Players confront the consequences of immortality, the curse of the Mara, and the lingering scars left by centuries of warfare, while navigating shifting alliances and hidden truths that challenge the Luofu’s carefully maintained order.",
        description3: "From a gameplay standpoint, the Xianzhou Luofu emphasizes scale and complexity. Its layered districts, bustling marketplaces, sanctums, and industrial docks encourage exploration and vertical navigation. Enemies range from corrupted mara-struck soldiers to Abundance-twisted monstrosities, reinforcing the narrative themes through combat. Quests often intertwine personal stories with ancient history, while puzzles and mechanics reflect the Luofu’s advanced yet tradition-bound society.",
        description4: "Together, the Xianzhou Luofu serves as a pivotal chapter in the Trailblazer’s journey—a place where philosophical conflict, living history, and gameplay systems converge, presenting a world that questions whether eternal life is a blessing, a curse, or something far more dangerous when left unchecked.",

        name: "Penacony",
        description1: "Penacony is a dazzling dream-city suspended between reality and illusion, once a prison world and now a galactic resort built on the power of collective dreams. Beneath its radiant lights and endless festivities lies a fragile system sustained by the influence of the Aeon of Harmony, where emotion, desire, and memory are shaped into shared dreamscapes. Penacony presents itself as a paradise of freedom and joy, yet its very foundation raises the question of whether happiness imposed by design can ever be genuine.",
        description2: "In the story, Penacony marks a dramatic shift in tone and scale for the Trailblazer’s journey. What begins as an invitation to a grand celebration quickly unravels into a mystery filled with deception, fractured identities, and hidden conflicts between factions. As players move between the waking world and the dream realm, they uncover Penacony’s buried past, the true cost of maintaining harmony, and the dangers of losing oneself within a perfect illusion. The narrative challenges the idea of escapism, forcing characters—and players—to confront uncomfortable truths masked by beauty and spectacle.",
        description3: "From a gameplay perspective, Penacony leans heavily into experimental mechanics and environmental storytelling. Its dreamscapes defy normal logic, featuring shifting layouts, surreal visuals, and puzzles that play with perspective and reality. Combat encounters often mirror the instability of the setting, while quests emphasize psychological themes, symbolism, and choice. Exploration rewards attention to detail, as subtle changes in the environment hint at deeper layers beneath the dream.",
        description4: "As a whole, Penacony stands as one of Honkai: Star Rail’s most ambitious settings—a world where lore, gameplay, and narrative fully intertwine, blurring the boundary between dream and truth, and asking whether a flawless dream is worth the price of awakening.",

        name: "Amphoreus",
        description1: "Amphoreus is a sealed and solemn world shaped by fate, prophecy, and ancient authority—a land that exists apart from the wider cosmos, bound by rigid laws that govern both destiny and choice. Its civilizations are steeped in ritual and myth, where history is not merely recorded but enforced, and the will of higher powers looms constantly over mortal lives. Unlike other worlds shaped by progress or decay, Amphoreus feels timeless, as though it has been caught in an unending moment of judgment.",
        description2: "In the story, Amphoreus introduces the Trailblazer to a conflict rooted not in survival or deception, but in inevitability. The world’s people live under the weight of predetermined outcomes, trials, and ordained roles, raising questions about free will and resistance. As the Trailblazer becomes entangled in Amphoreus’s internal struggles, they are forced to confront a society that believes destiny must be obeyed—even when that destiny leads to ruin. The narrative explores whether fate is an unbreakable law, or something meant to be challenged.",
        description3: "From a gameplay perspective, Amphoreus emphasizes deliberate pacing, trials, and symbolic encounters. Exploration often feels ceremonial, with environments designed to evoke reverence and tension rather than comfort. Enemies and bosses reflect the world’s themes of judgment and authority, while quests frequently place the player in morally weighted situations rather than simple right-or-wrong choices. Mechanics and encounters reinforce the sense that every action carries consequence, mirroring the world’s fixation on destiny.",
        description4: "Taken as a whole, Amphoreus stands as a philosophical chapter in the Trailblazer’s journey—a world where lore, gameplay, and story converge to question the nature of fate itself, and whether the path laid before you is something to follow… or something to defy.",
